Advent of Code is an annual programming event featuring 25 daily puzzles released every December. Each challenge is designed to test your problem-solving skills while providing a fun, festive way to improve coding techniques. This repository contains my solutions for the 2024 Advent of Code, implemented in Kotlin language. In future, I'll also add solution from previous years.
The whole event can be found at https://adventofcode.com/
